## OmegaWarps

OmegaWarps is a modern unique plugin that allows you warp around your server in style. Players
are able to set warps that "belong to the server" and other warps that your players will be
able to own.

For further information about this plugin, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/OmegaWeaponDev/OmegaWarps/wiki)

### Installation & Downloading

You can always find the latest version by visiting the [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/omegawarps.74788/) 
page. This plugin works on all Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers from version 1.13 and above.

When it comes to installing the plugin, Simply drop the omegawarps-[version number].jar into your servers plugin folder and then start your server.
Then you are able to adjust all the plugin messages and config settings to suit your needs!

Notes: If you want players to pay for their own warps you will also need to install [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) installed as well.
