## Installation, Downloading & Updating

### Downloading:

You can always find the latest version by visiting the [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/omeganames.78327/) 
page. This plugin works on all Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers from version 1.13 and above.

### Installing:

When it comes to installing the plugin, Simply drop the OmegaWarps-[version number].jar into your servers plugin folder and then start your server.

Notes: If you want players to pay for their own warps you will also need to install [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) as well.

### Updating: 

Updating is very easy, all you're needing to do is download the new version of the plugin and replace the old version in your plugins folder.

I have implemented an Auto Config Updater that will automatically update all the files if I have changed them in any way.
